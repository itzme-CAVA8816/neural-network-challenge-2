 # Student Loan Prediction System

## Overview
This project was for educational purposes and aims to develop and create a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.


## Prerequisites

The starter files consist of the following files: 
- `attrition.ipynb`

## Technologies Used 
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- sklearn
- pathlib

## Built With
- Visual Studio Code - The source code editor used for development.
- GitHub Copilot - AI assistant that helps in writing better code.
- ChatGPT - AI model for generating documentation and guidance.
- Perplexity - AI assistant that helps generate and write cleaner code.

## Features
